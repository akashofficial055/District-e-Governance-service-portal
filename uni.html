    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Purvanchal University, Jaunpur renamed as Veer Bahadur Singh Purvanchal University (in the honour of late Shri Veer Bahadur Singh, former Chief Minister of the state), was established on 2nd October 1987 as an affiliating university under U.P. state university act 1973. Continuous qualitative and quantitative growth, excellence in academic and administrative activities, transparent and efficient academic administration have been some of the distinct characteristics on the basis of which the university emerged as one of the leading university of the country. Started with the 68 affiliated colleges, the university now has widened it’s spectrum of activities with 552 affiliated graduate and post-graduate colleges and students enrolment of nearly three lacs and eighty thousand in 3 Districts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh.</span></p>

    <h3 id="mcetoc_1h6rgsfuv1">University Gate</h3>
    <p>The university is located at 10 km from the historic city of Jaunpur on Jaunpur-Shahganj road which divides it’s 171.5 acres campus into two. Jaunpur is well connected by Train, Road and Air with rest of the country.The infrastructure development, achievement of academic excellence, quality assurance in the higher education and socio-economic development of this highly backward &amp; rural region of Eastern Uttar Pradesh are some of the priority areas for which the university is putting its best efforts. The beginning of two-year full-time residential MBA course in 1990 was one of the first steps towards making change in the character of the university from affiliating to affiliating cum-residential university.</p>

    <h3 id="mcetoc_1h6rgsfuv2">Gandhi Vatika</h3>
    <p>The dearth of technical and professional educational facilities and growing demand for need based courses in the region have been the guiding factors that have led the university on the path of continuous academic growth with the beginning of 16 more residential courses in the various streams including Engineering &amp; Technology (B.Tech.), Modern and Applied Sciences (MBT), Management ( Finance &amp; Control, HRD), Business Economics, Pharmacy (B.Pharmacy) and Applied Social Sciences(MAP, Mass communication) in mere 15 years since it’s inception..</p>

    <div class="col-lg-8">
    <h3 id="mcetoc_1h6rgsfuv3">Future Plans</h3>
    <p>The University also plans to start courses in Medical Sciences, Library &amp; Information Sciences , B. Tech [Biotech] in near future, which would certainly prove to be a mile-stone in the multidirectional academic expansion of the university. The inclusion of university in the 12(B) of the UGC and its accreditation by NAAC in the year 2001 and 2004 respectively, have been pivotal in moving the university in list of prominent centers of higher learning on national higher education map. These developments proved to be instrumental in the academic expansion of the university, especially in promoting the quality teaching and research.</p>

    <h3 id="mcetoc_1h6rgsfuv4">Extension Activities</h3>
    <p>Apart from it’s regular teaching, research and extension activities, the university has always discharged it’s social responsibilities also. Financial assistance to the relatives of Kargil Martyrs, regular support to the victims of natural disasters including the recent financial assistance of Rs. 51 Lakhs to Tsunami victims are some of the examples that make us a socially responsive organization. Recently the university has organised Bapu Bazar especially for socially backward people in which used clothes were sold on nominal rates (2 , 5 Rupees) . In terms of infrastructure development too, the university has made a tremendous growth as is quite evident from it’s well developed fully residential campus, consisting of all the modern infrastructural support system required for an effective higher teaching-learning.</p>
